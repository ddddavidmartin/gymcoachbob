Backlog of tasks left to do:

* add common prefixes for items in strings.xml (for example every hint should start with hint_ and every button description should start with button_)
* implement functionality to exit the app
* add functionality to display that user has to enter text before adding a workout
* use official Android icon set for ActionBar items (for example to add a new workout)
* add 'About' screen with contact and version information
* use ContentResolver to save currently edited fields
* add popup after logging an exercise: "good work boy / girl" and variations on it
* start with exercises rather than workouts (and just have a list of exercises)
 * maybe add another activity that works on exercises, and later on the workout one can be extended
* consider showing the number of days since the last time an exercise was done
* consider grouping exercises. Have the user select what it is good for (legs, arms, shoulders, cardio, core, etc.) and make it possible to select more than one
* start with simple way of saving everything, then find something better like json for example

Backlog of tasks left to do:

* implement functionality to exit the app
* add functionality to display that user has to enter text before adding a workout
* use official Android icon set for ActionBar items (for example to add a new exercise)
* add 'About' screen with contact and version information
* use ContentResolver to save currently edited fields
* add popup after logging an exercise: "good work boy / girl" and variations on it (use first name)
* consider grouping exercises. Have the user select what it is good for (legs, arms, shoulders, cardio, core, etc.) and make it possible to select more than one

* fix runtime errors that show up in Log

* add separate section with deleted exercises, so that their information is not lost after they are first removed
 * show deleted always at the bottom as a folder with exercises

* consider ways to prevent corruption to the stored exercises
 * use atomic operation to write it (non-interruptible method?)
 * maybe write temp file first and then overwrite existing one
 * store a couple of previous versions and offer to load a previous one if loading a new one fails
 * make sure that a new release never breaks older versions (add requirement and test for it)
* consider checking return values when adding new exercises, because it may break at some point

* work on tests in general
* add swiping in ViewExerciseActivity to swipe to previous or next exercise, see https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html

* consider implementing the layout for multiple sizes
 * https://developer.android.com/training/design-navigation/multiple-sizes.html

* show current date and a cog wheel next to it to change it
* investigate whether returning partial Exercise lists is better than returning an empty one in JsonUtils.java

* possible performance / memory footprint improvement:
  only load exercise names first, and actual session data only when an exercise is opened
 * save the separate exercises in different files as well

* add onboarding process where user sets their name and gender
* use SortedList for Sessions rather than sorting them by hand
* consider not sorting the sessions at startup or at least check best case performance for adding to already sorted lists
* create release branch with apk in it
* build apk with obfuscation
* show last 10 commits on webpage
* use the date string format set on the current device (EU vs. AU vs. US)
* consider loading and saving the exercises in the background (json utils in a separate thread or service?)
 * more info on AsyncTask https://youtu.be/jtlRNNhane0
 * for a start consider just the write process as separate thread
* find proper cog wheel button for changing the date or use 'change' as text but make it blue and underscored like a link

* license the app before putting it on the app store
 * https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html

* add option to import and export exercises
 * maybe provide example pre-populated set on website
* consider adding a test mode where exercises are prepopulated on the app

* set up post-push hook to update latest commits on static website
* use proper date formatter when setting the date in onDateSet in new session activity

* get Photoshop trial version and update app logo
* implement account switcher functinoality
 * have a demo account pre-filled with common exercises
* make it possible to remove sessions

* add decimal dot between the two number pickers for weight selection in NewSessionActivity
 * consider adding it to the numbers in the second numberpicker itself (eg. '.1, .2, .3 etc.')
* add markers inbetween session view: 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago, ..., 1 month ago, 2 months ago, ..., 1 year ago, ...

* make it possible to rename / edit exercises and sessions
 * add a replace method in addition to add and remove
 * figure out how to call onActivityResult in Main activity from activity
   started in RecyclerView
 * or, figure out how to get onActionItemClicked into Main activity
   (we may have to implement the whole ActionMode.Callback interface,
   or create a new interface that only calls what we want)
* check why adding new Exercise with keyboard visible has glitchy scroll animation

* have cancel and confirm buttons for adding exercises and sessions, similar
  to alert dialog when deleting an exercise

* implement next and done for NumberPickers when adding a session
  (see Android alarm clock as a reference)
 * investigate why going from entering text in one numberpicker to entering
   text in the next one does not work

* implement functionality to add comments to Sessions (for example 'hard!' or 'easy!')

* tasks to be considered for completion for first release:
 * user switcher with option to add a new account
 * example account

* reduce size of the exercise cards so that more fit on the screen
* check whether date field in session view is wide enough as it breaks the line
  on the emulator
* add Description field for exercises
 * show it above the list of Sessions
 * enter it when adding an exercise
 * check whether json even supports strings across multiple lines as values
* for NewExerciseActivity, rather than having "Done" in the keyboard to close
  the keyboard, add the Exercise straight from there

* extend Util.timeSince to show number of weeks, months and years as well
 * for example '1 week ago (7 days), more than 1 week ago (x days), more than 1 month ago (x days)'

* find a better way of highlighting the selected exercise (for example showing it in blue)

* add support for time based exercises
 * store time and distance in json
 * select from the two when adding a new exercise
  * two options, have an i button next to it which pops up a small explanation
    on what the two options mean, for example
    weight-based: Exercises measured in weight and repetitions, for example
                  sit-ups, lifts, lunges
    time-based: Exercises measured in time and distance, for example running,
                cycling or swimming
 * when selecting an exercise load the respective title as for the exercise type
  * consider dynamically loading the exercise or having two separate exercise
    classes with separate layouts (probably the latter as it offers more flexibility)
 * when adding a session have the same for weight, but have two selectors for
   time-based exercises: time hh:mm:ss and distance xx.xx

* bold entries where the weight has changed for weight-based Sessions
* add search functionality to search for exercises (see tripview for an example)

* implement widget for off-screen to add Sessions

* check that the date update on a new day actually works
 * it may not work as we for example do not count a full day if only half a
   day passed (should be fixed now but nevertheless check)

* consider grouping Sessions through a wrapper
 * rather than having a separate card for each Session, only have one card per day
 * the list of Sessions would look much less busy that way and probably allowed
   to show more information as well (for example if it always allowed space for
   3 sets, and expanded when it needed to show more)

* implement functionality to select the directory in which exercises are saved
 * that way we can select the dropbox folder to sync the stored exercises

* work out the correct minSdkVersion etc., this may resolve the startup errors
  that show up as well
 * https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html

* rather than sorting sessions by time, sort them on the same day by a counter
 * otherwise, if a Session is added the next day at an earlier time it will
   be added before the other ones

* consider allowing reading of Exercises even when writing is not allowed
* consider using internal memory as fallback for when external is not available
 * always write to both memories
 * fall back to internal if reading from external fails
* check that writing to file works on API > 18, as in that case we are not
  requesting the permission

DONE:

* consider notifying the Adapter that a new exercise is added
 * alternatively, find out why the view already updates as it is
  * possibly because we draw the main activity again when we return from the 'new exercise' activity

* use DatePicker and NumberPicker to select weight and repetitions when adding
  a Session
  https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/pickers.html
  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/NumberPicker.html

* add widget to add sessions to an exercise
 * we probably want to use a Dialog for that
 * https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html
 * https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dialogs.html#dialogs-behavior
 * https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dialogs.html#dialogs-full-screen-dialogs
 * probably good to use an Activity, and make it optional to be a dialog.
  * this way it will be easier to extend it but still be flexible
  * we do not quite know yet what input we need to provide for example
  * if it is only little input, we can show it as a dialog, if not we can use full Activity
* consider making an Activity a dialog
 * https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html#DialogFragment
   "Tip: If you want a custom dialog, you can instead display an Activity as a dialog instead of using the Dialog APIs."

* maybe card_layout and row_item are separate because of different types, try passing in the correct one similar to example
 https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html

* use Log function rather than System.out.println
* add license headers and license file
* write version number for logs to file
 * https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/versioning.html
* use proper margins for list of Sessions
* center the date text in new session activity

* make it possible to use half kilos
 * http://stackoverflow.com/q/18794265
* make it possible to have decimal values for weights
 * a) include decimal values in existing NumberPicker
 * b) add a second NumberPicker to select the grams for the kilos
      the benefit of this is avoiding a hacky solution for the values
      still need to update the selection everywhere to support decimals

* sort sessions in descending order
* find good way of reloading list of exercises after one is added
 * scroll to bottom when a new exercise is added
* scroll to top when a new session is added
* add confirmation dialog before deleting an exercise

* consider renaming repository and account to beartiger_bear
 * disagree for now as it reads weirdly

* customise how date is shown:
 * no date if sets are on the same day and the current Session is not the topmost visible
 * day and month if a session is in the current year (not implemented as it does not look right)
 * day, month and year if session is not in the current year

* fix issue where adding two new sessions to the top results in both of them
  showing the full date (probably because the second one is not updated when
  there is a new one)
 * does not happen anymore now that new sessions on the same day are sorted
   chronologically

* add confirmation dialog before deleting exercises

* add utility functions for Dates
* correctly set the date for the last added Session
 * either the first Session added or the latest one added on the same day as
   the first Session in the overall list
* show "Today" when current date is selected (and not just when the dialog is opened
  for the first time)

* consider showing the number of days since the last time an exercise was done
 * http://stackoverflow.com/a/13936264
 * make sure the Exercise view is updated when a Session is added

* update the time since last Session when a new Session is added
 * maybe mark the selected Exercise when it is opened and update it when the
   we go back to the main overview
 * mark in ExerciseWrapper the last Exercise that is accessed? Or would that be
   overwritten before onResume when the adapter is used?

* show the time since last exercise session as well after the date (+xd)

* use public static String TAG in util for the log output tag
 * this way we do not have to define it in every single class that uses logging

* avoid memory leaks by not keeping Activity Context references

* consider moving 'days since' logic into the Exercise class
 * this is where it is determined through the Session
 * ExerciseViewAdapter needs days since last Session
 * SessionViewAdapter needs days between two Sessions
 * we may be able to remove the lastSession method as it is only used to
   determine the days since the last Session

* update the 'days since' infos when a new day occurred since the app was last
  opened
 * probably save the current date at startup and compare against it when
   onResume is called
 * move this into its own function to keep it clear that it belongs to the 'days
   since' logic

* move the logic for the days since for the Sessions into its own methods,
so that it is clear where it is used and it is not magically strewn all
through the code base
 * it probably makes sense to have a wrapper around Sessions so that we can
 still call the usual 'get' and 'add' methods, but as well have methods
 to determine whether a Session should have '+d' info for example

* consider taking half day differences into account for 'days since' view
 * for example exercises added in the evening are not shown as a full day later
   when looked at in the morning. Maybe normalise each date so that they are
   at the same time? When we calculate the time since, set both in a calendar
   to the same time?

* update second Session when a new one is added at the top
 * probably safe to always update the next Session when a new one is added as
   every time a Session is added in the middle (with a new one on a separate
   day following after it), the 'days since' need to be updated

* investigate why deleting Exercises crashes the app

* store exercises on sd card
 * use .json extension

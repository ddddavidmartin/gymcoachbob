Backlog of tasks left to do:

* implement functionality to exit the app
* add functionality to display that user has to enter text before adding a workout
* use official Android icon set for ActionBar items (for example to add a new exercise)
* add 'About' screen with contact and version information
* use ContentResolver to save currently edited fields
* add popup after logging an exercise: "good work boy / girl" and variations on it (use first name)
* consider showing the number of days since the last time an exercise was done
* consider grouping exercises. Have the user select what it is good for (legs, arms, shoulders, cardio, core, etc.) and make it possible to select more than one

* add separate section with deleted exercises, so that their information is not lost after they are first removed
 * show deleted always at the bottom as a folder with exercises
* find way of highlighting the selected exercise

* consider ways to prevent corruption to the stored exercises
 * use atomic operation to write it (non-interruptible method?)
 * maybe write temp file first and then overwrite existing one
 * store a couple of previous versions and offer to load a previous one if loading a new one fails
 * make sure that a new release never breaks older versions (add requirement and test for it)
* consider checking return values when adding new exercises, because it may break at some point
* consider notifying the Adapter that a new exercise is added
 * alternatively, find out why the view already updates as it is
  * possibly because we draw the main activity again when we return from the 'new exercise' activity

* work on tests in general
* add swiping in ViewExerciseActivity to swipe to previous or next exercise, see https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html

* customise how date is shown:
 * no date if sets are on the same day and the current Session is not the topmost visible
 * day and month if a session is in the current year
 * day, month and year if session is not in the current year

* consider implementing the layout for multiple sizes
 * https://developer.android.com/training/design-navigation/multiple-sizes.html

* add confirmation dialog before deleting exercises

* show current date and a cog wheel next to it to change it
* investigate whether returning partial Exercise lists is better than returning an empty one in JsonUtils.java


* possible performance / memory footprint improvement:
  only load exercise names first, and actual session data only when an exercise is opened
 * save the separate exercises in different files as well

* add onboarding process where user sets their name and gender
* use SortedList for Sessions rather than sorting them by hand
* consider not sorting the sessions at startup or at least check best case performance for adding to already sorted lists
* create release branch with apk in it
* build apk with obfuscation
* show last 10 commits on webpage
* use the date string format set on the current device (EU vs. AU vs. US)
* consider loading and saving the exercises in the background (json utils in a separate thread or service?)
 * more info on AsyncTask https://youtu.be/jtlRNNhane0
 * for a start consider just the write process as separate thread
* find proper cog wheel button for changing the date or use 'change' as text but make it blue and underscored like a link

* license the app before putting it on the app store
 * https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html

* add option to import and export exercises
 * maybe provide example pre-populated set on website
* consider adding a test mode where exercises are prepopulated on the app

* set up post-push hook to update latest commits on static website
* show "Today" when current date is selected (and not just when the dialog is opened
  for the first time)
* use proper date formatter when setting the date in onDateSet in new session activity

* get Photoshop trial version and update app logo
* implement account switcher functinoality
 * have a demo account pre-filled with common exercises
* make it possible to remove sessions

* add decimal dot between the two number pickers for weight selection in NewSessionActivity
* add markers inbetween session view: 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago, ..., 1 month ago, 2 months ago, ..., 1 year ago, ...

* make it possible to rename / edit exercises and sessions
 * add a replace method in addition to add and remove
* check why adding new Exercise with keyboard visible has glitchy scroll animation

* consider renaming repository and account to beartiger_bear

* have cancel and confirm buttons for adding exercises and sessions, similar
  to alert dialog when deleting an exercise

* implement next and done for NumberPickers when adding a session
  (see Android alarm clock as a reference)
 * investigate why going from entering text in one numberpicker to entering
   text in the next one does not work

DONE:

* use DatePicker and NumberPicker to select weight and repetitions when adding
  a Session
  https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/pickers.html
  https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/NumberPicker.html

* add widget to add sessions to an exercise
 * we probably want to use a Dialog for that
 * https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html
 * https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dialogs.html#dialogs-behavior
 * https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dialogs.html#dialogs-full-screen-dialogs
 * probably good to use an Activity, and make it optional to be a dialog.
  * this way it will be easier to extend it but still be flexible
  * we do not quite know yet what input we need to provide for example
  * if it is only little input, we can show it as a dialog, if not we can use full Activity
* consider making an Activity a dialog
 * https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html#DialogFragment
   "Tip: If you want a custom dialog, you can instead display an Activity as a dialog instead of using the Dialog APIs."

* maybe card_layout and row_item are separate because of different types, try passing in the correct one similar to example
 https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html

* use Log function rather than System.out.println
* add license headers and license file
* write version number for logs to file
 * https://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/versioning.html
* use proper margins for list of Sessions
* center the date text in new session activity

* make it possible to use half kilos
 * http://stackoverflow.com/q/18794265
* make it possible to have decimal values for weights
 * a) include decimal values in existing NumberPicker
 * b) add a second NumberPicker to select the grams for the kilos
      the benefit of this is avoiding a hacky solution for the values
      still need to update the selection everywhere to support decimals

* sort sessions in descending order
* find good way of reloading list of exercises after one is added
 * scroll to bottom when a new exercise is added
* scroll to top when a new session is added
* add confirmation dialog before deleting an exercise
